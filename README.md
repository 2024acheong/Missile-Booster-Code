# Missile-Booster-Code

Missile Booster Performance Analysis
This project is a computational tool for analyzing the effect of pop-out booster size on missile performance. Developed as part of an engineering class project, the code allows for modifications to key missile parameters, including booster size, upper stage dimensions, specific impulse (Isp), and grain loadings. The goal is to optimize system risk and performance by simulating and evaluating different design configurations.

Features
Adjustable booster size and upper stage parameters
Simulation of missile propulsion dynamics
Performance analysis based on thrust, burn time, and efficiency
Customizable Isp and grain loadings for optimization
Designed for evaluating trade-offs in naval missile systems
Technologies Used
Python (or the programming language used)
Numerical simulation and optimization techniques
Aerospace engineering principles
Usage
Clone the repository and run the script with desired input parameters to analyze performance trade-offs. Future improvements may include enhanced visualization and integration with advanced optimization techniques.
